# react-challenge-base-tmp
Yet another reactjs boilerplate
<br>
This is a simple project base to start developing react app with tailwindcss and redux
- Auth, languages services
- Basic login/register implementation
- Smooth animations using react-dom and motion framer
- Clean structure with RTK query api templates and stuf
Too lazy to write anymore :) guess you will have to figure out the rest
